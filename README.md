# PerDiem Archive

## Project Overview

PerDiem was a pioneering web application in the music industry, serving as the first investment platform for music. The platform allowed artists to secure investments in a similar way to startups, providing a sustainable alternative to traditional fundraising sites.

## Development Process

The initial idea for PerDiem sparked from noticing the struggles of many artists who couldn't sustain themselves using traditional crowdfunding sites. Despite having a significant fanbase, artists lacked a way to tap into their potential. 

The first iteration of PerDiem was a simple, manually operated site that could accept payments and track transactions. The main goal was to validate the concept and test the market reaction. The response was overwhelming, with investments coming from a diverse set of people, and interest from artists, labels, and other music industry folks.

During SXSW, PerDiem was showcased for the first time outside of the initial network, leading to increased attention from investors and media.

## Technical Aspects

The development process involved a complete overhaul of the site from scratch. The initial design was cool and mysterious, but it turned out that users were hesitant to put their credit cards into an underground-looking website. This led to a deep dive into UI and design principles, with careful consideration of color psychology, button shapes, and user navigation.

The final design was clean and comforting, with a focus on familiarity and functionality. The site was optimized for a wide range of screen sizes and browser interpretations. Data from real-time user tracking was leveraged to improve the user experience, leading to a 700% increase in artist applications and a significant increase in investments.

## Current Status

PerDiem, recognized as a pioneer in the music industry as the first investment platform for music, has now officially closed it's doors. The platform had been showcased at several conferences globally, offering valuable insights into its development and impact. Despite its closure, PerDiem's legacy continues as we've compiled all our learnings and resources, hoping to inspire and guide future generations to develop and implement similar innovative concepts in the music industry.
